# Lab14

## Description

For this lab, I have developed a website that offers users the capability to create their own accounts, log in securely,
and then begin posting content. For individuals who haven't yet registered, they will only have access to the general homepage.
To participate in posting content, they will first need to create an account.

Classes we added for this lab:
- AuthenticationController
- SiteUsers
- Posts
- SiteUserRepo
- PostsRepo
- home.html
- homeBeforeAuth.html
- login.html
- signup.html
- with their css styling files
